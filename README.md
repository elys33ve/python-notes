Notes on python syntax and stuff

i guess this is just a library of stuff to refer back to when i inevitably forget some of the basic 
python syntax, or just need to remember a specific statement for something.

i originally created these for myself, but went back and added a lot of extra notes when i shared it
with some classmates who had never used a text-based programming language before, and were just starting
to use python for class.
